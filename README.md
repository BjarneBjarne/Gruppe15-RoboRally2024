## Playing a game
### Programming phase
Once all players have confirmed their starting position and direction, they are each dealt a hand of programming cards.
Each player will select up to five cards to play during a turn. The cards are played by dragging them from hand, on the
left side, to your program registers, at the bottom of your player mat at the bottom center. Once every player has
chosen the programming cards, they wish to play, press the Ready button. When all players have pressed the ready button,
the interaction phase begins.

### Interaction phase
Each player's programming cards are execute in the order of their distance to the antenna on the board, with the closest
player being first. All the player programs at register 1 are executed first, followed by the board elements activating,
as well as player lasers. After that, a new order is decided by the antenna, where after all player programs at register
2 is activated, and so on.
If you are as lucky as to have a programming card or an upgrade card which allows a choice at its register, you need to
make the choice by pressing any of the choice buttons, located where the Ready button were. When you've chosen an
option, the game continues.
When the 5'th and final register is done, the upgrade phase starts.

### Upgrade phase
At the upgrade phase, players take turn in buying upgrade cards.

Upgrade cards can be bought with your energy cubes. You can view your number of energy cubes on your player mat. Energy
cubes can be collected by ending your register on an energy cube, or ending your turn on an energy space, located where
energy cubes are put at the start of the game.
Energy cubes do not respawn.

Yellow (permanent) cards can be bought by dragging them
to the top of your player mat.
Red (temporary) cards can be bought by dragging them to one of the slots to the right of your player mat.

If you want to replace an upgrade card, you can drag a new upgrade card on top of an owned upgrade card, effectively
removing the old card.

reach in order, going from checkpoint 1, to 2, etc. You can reach a checkpoint, simply by ending a register on a
checkpoint space.
