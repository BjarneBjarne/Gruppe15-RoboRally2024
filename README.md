## Opening the application
To open the RoboRally-application, navigate to the folder Gruppe15-RoboRally2024 and double-click the file
"RoboRally.jar".

## Starting a new game
To start a new game, once the application is open, click "New Game" in the Main Menu. Select the desired course (as of
prototype, only the first one is functional). Select the amount of players (2-6) under "Settings", write a name (names
MUST be different from each other) and select a robot character for each player. Press Start.

## Initializing a game
After a course is loaded, it is time for each player to pick a starting position for their robot. Starting with player
1, each player selects their starting position, by clicking on one of the six white circles on the board and then
picking their starting direction by clicking one of the four arrows.

## Playing a game
Once all players have selected a starting position and direction, they are each dealt a hand of programming cards.
Each player will select up to five cards to play during a turn. The cards are played by dragging them from the
Command Cards pane to the Program pane. Once every player has chosen the programming cards, they wish to play, press
the Finish Programming button (as soon as the program supports multiple devices playing the same game, this button will
make more sense, due to players competing to finish programming first) followed by the Execute Program button. This
will execute each player's programming cards in order and a new hand will be dealt and a new round of programming will
begin.

## Winning a game
The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach all the different check points on the board.

## Saving a game
To save the current state of the game, press the exit button in the top right, click "Ok", click "Save", enter a file
name and click "Ok". The application will save the game and then close.

## Loading a game
To load a game, click "Load Game" on the Main Menu. Choose the game file, you wish to load and click "Open" (or
double-click the file).
